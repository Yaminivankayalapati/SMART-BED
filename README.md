# SMART-BED
SMART BED is for an IoT-based health monitoring system using an ESP32 board, MAX30105 sensor, gas sensor, and ultrasonic sensor. The system measures heart rate, SpO2 (oxygen saturation), gas levels, and distance (likely for saline level monitoring). The data is sent to the Blynk cloud platform for remote monitoring and alert generation.
